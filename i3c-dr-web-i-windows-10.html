It's me, Peter Parker. Your friendly neighborhood. you know. I've come a long way from being the boy who was bit by a spider. Back then, nothing seemed to go right for me. Now. - Wow, look, it's Spider-Man! people really like me. Hey, stick around! It's gonna start again in a couple minutes. - Yeah. - That's OK. The city is safe and sound. Guess I've had something to do with that. My uncle Ben would be proud. I still go to school, top of my class. Now, the Hamiltonian shows

Anyways, heregoes: I have always been a computerphile, I remember being about 7-8 years old in the 2nd grade and having a family friend donate us a Windows 3.1 computer and being completely mesmerized with how it worked. I also remember taking it apart one day and experimenting moving around some wires on the inside (which in retrospect I'm pretty sure were panel headers. tl;dr: I created a small application to scrape web pages, find all the links to files and present them in a table. You can then select any number of URLs and export these to a text file, which can be read by wget.

This is a very long story so you can skip some parts if you like. Note: This contains spoilers on PvZ 2. If you haven't played it/completed it, I recommend you to try to skip the spoilers that are mentioned here. I may be a little bit mixed up with the dates and timeline. There EDIT: A big large-huge THANK YOU to everyone who took even 10 seconds to tell me how screwed I am. I appreciate it, genuinely, as I have no one to even commiserate with here.

It's owned by a husband and wife, and they have 3 employees, including myself. The husband was an engineer with Agilent/Keysight Two months ago I launched my first Steam release into Early Access, Starcom: Nexus (https://store.steampowered.com/app/863590/Starcom_Nexus/). My personal inspiration for the game was an ancient DOS game called "Starflight" that I loved as a kid. I wanted to create an open-world universe full of mystery that combined the joy of exploration with the joy of blasting alien ships until they explode like piñatas.

Sorry everyone. I know I said I'd update daily. But with exams coming up I've found that hard. But hopefully, all goes well next week. Oh, and easter's coming up, so here's a pre-emptive happy easter from the Christian community! - PM Imran Khan to visit Iran on April 21 (https://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2019/04/13/pm-imran-khan-to-visit-iran-on-april-21/) Premier Khan is expected to meet Iran’s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei and President Hassan Rouhani during his visit. The purpose. Every year or so, I tell myself that it's time to give Linux a serious try. This year, I decided to make a serious effort. I picked Ubuntu really just because I knew it existed and figured it was as good as any for getting familiar with the OS, especially for someone coming from Windows. I thought my experience might be useful for others contemplating such a move and particularly for helping to shape one's expectations. tl;dr - it works well, but it doesn't "just work." It takes. Hello all, As the title says, I greatly need some advice on whether I should exchange my X1 Extreme for a new unit. I'll try to summarize best I can: (spoiler alert, it's a terrible summary, TL;DR at bottom) (Few quick notes on my unit: - X1 Extreme i7 8850h - 16 GB single ram , 512 SSD , 4K screen - average tempature is 60 degrees C when web browsing with chrome, using Slack, Todoist, maybe few other apps) - switched to discrete GPU after about TL;DR: Are there any ways to improve my PHP editing work flow, specifically in terms of efficiency?

Hi Classic WoW Making a post here to try and summarise all the bugs and legion mechanics in the demo. This is not ment do bash on the Classic Demo, its only ment for constructive feedback. WoW Classic devs wants the community to help point out wrongs, so im making this thread to try and find all of them. But i need your help, so comment down below and i will edit in more bulletpoints in this post. All this information is combined from earlier posts on this subreddit, youtube videos I went back and read some of my old posts about this game from 2015. Stuff that would seem alien to players today (and we've forgotten/forced out of our minds due to how long we've been playing) Here are some gems: - Posted 5th April 2015: "I just paid for stamina.
